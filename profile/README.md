## 🛡️ About Project Badger

At its core, Project Badger is building a comprehensive **Security Dashboard** designed to help server administrators monitor, detect, and respond to threats in real-time. We aim to provide intuitive, powerful, and scalable tools that ensure servers remain secure and efficient.

In addition to our main dashboard, we explore and develop:
- Network monitoring tools
- Server hardening scripts
- Log analysis and intrusion detection
- API-based protection systems
- Admin alerts and auto-response frameworks

Whether you're running a small web server or a large game hosting platform, our tools are built to adapt and scale.
